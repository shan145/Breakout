"""Subcontroller module for Breakout

This module contains the subcontroller to manage a single game in the Breakout App. 
Instances of Play represent a single game.  If you want to restart a new game, you are 
expected to make a new instance of Play.

The subcontroller Play manages the paddle, ball, and bricks.  These are model objects.  
Their classes are defined in models.py.

Most of your work on this assignment will be in either this module or models.py.
Whether a helper method belongs in this module or models.py is often a complicated
issue.  If you do not know, ask on Piazza and we will answer."""

# PRIMARY RULE: Play can only access attributes in models.py via getters/setters
# Play is NOT allowed to access anything in breakout.py (Subcontrollers are not
# permitted to access anything in their parent. To see why, take CS 3152)

class Play(object):
    """An instance controls a single game of breakout.
    
    This subcontroller has a reference to the ball, paddle, and bricks. It animates the 
    ball, removing any bricks as necessary.  When the game is won, it stops animating.  
    You should create a NEW instance of Play (in Breakout) if you want to make a new game.
    
    If you want to pause the game, tell this controller to draw, but do not update.  See 
    subcontrollers.py from Lecture 25 for an example.
    
    INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES:
        _paddle [Paddle]: the paddle to play with 
        _bricks [list of Brick]: the list of bricks still remaining 
        _ball   [Ball, or None if waiting for a serve]:  the ball to animate
        _tries  [int >= 0]: the number of tries left 
    
    As you can see, all of these attributes are hidden.  You may find that you want to
    access an attribute in class Breakout. It is okay if you do, but you MAY NOT ACCESS 
    THE ATTRIBUTES DIRECTLY. You must use a getter and/or setter for any attribute that 
    you need to access in Breakout.  Only add the getters and setters that you need for 
    Breakout.
    
    You may change any of the attributes above as you see fit. For example, you may want
    to add new objects on the screen (e.g power-ups).  If you make changes, please list
    the changes with the invariants.
