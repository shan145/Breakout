Extensions Added: 
1. Added user control over bounces by adding method called _determineDirection()
This method is called in updateBall() when the paddle collides with the ball to determine
which direction the ball moves afterwards. 

2. Added sound by adding method called createSound(). This method creates a list 
consisting of Sound objects and called in updateBall() when the ball collides with 
the brick.
